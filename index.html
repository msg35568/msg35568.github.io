	<tr><TD><H3>History</H3>
	<P>Founded in 1967, the St. Louis Blues were part of the NHL's expansion from 6 to 12 teams. 
	First owned by Sid Salomon Jr., a St. Louis native himself, the team was selected to be in St. Louis due to its central location and pre-exisiting arena.
	Named after the infamous song "Saint Louis Blues" by W.C. Handy, the Blues embrace their musical name sake with their team symbol, The Blue Note. 
	Leading the Blues at the helm was coach Lynn Patrick in their first season. Like any new franchise, the team stuggled with a 4-13-2 record to start the franchises inception.
	However, following those first 19 games, Patrick was replaced as head coach by former assistant Scotty Bowman. Bowman went on the lead the Blues to win the new Western Conference and then to the Stanley Cup Finals.
	This first season served as the catalist to spark a winning tradition within the organization.

	<tr><td><h3>Preformance</H3>
	<p>As said above, in their frist season, The Blues reached the Stanley Cup Finals in the 1967-1968 season. The following seaon the Blues reached the Stanley Cup Finals yet again. However the outcome was much the same as the Blues lost in 4 games yet again to the Montreal Canadiens in the 1968-1969 season. The Third seaon of the Blues seemed to be a copy of the previous two. After winning the western conference three seasons in a row, the Blues fell again in the Stanley Cup Finals. This time at the hands of the Boston Bruins in four games. The Blues currently have the largest streak without winning a championship in the NHL. After reaching the Finals three years in arow at the teams inception, The Blues have yet to go back to the Finals. However there is hope for the team.  After coming off a 82-49-24 season where the blues reached the Conference Finals, they return a team full of youth and talent. 	</p></td></tr>
	<tr><td><h3>Connection to the City</h3>
	<p>As a St.Louis resident, I have the luxury of seeing first hand just how speical The Blues are to the City and it's patrons. With the NFL taking away the Ram's from St. Louis and moving them to L.A. The Blues and Cardinals have created a sence of pride in St. Louis more than ever. With such a young roster as well with new players such as Robbie Fabri and Colton Parayko, the city is ready to win thier first ever Stanley Cup and end the longest drought in NHL history.</p></td></tr>
